#Sane Defaults for Linux/Unix Software

## Project Status
partially complete (lacks an installer and needs more configs)

##The Problem
Software on Linux and Unix is awesome. But let's face it, tons of good software for them lack sensible and easy to understand defaults. la aliases to ls -a, but not always. Common command line programs like ls, grep, and git often have their fully functioning built in color support disabled by default. Vim has syntax highlighting, its improved command syntax, and line numbers disabled by default. But what if there were better config files to solve this problem? That's where this project comes in handy.

##Goals
- avoid interfering with the results a user expects to get when running a command
- make programs more intuitive and easier to understand
- make programs safer and more secure
- enable settings that commonly confuse users when they are disabled (and vice versa)
- keep configurations minimal, including only what the average user of a command might find useful

##Helping Out
This project is based off of my current configs repo on GitHub (though it has a very different purpose). I have already added some configs that offer pretty sensible defaults, but I need opinions on what other people find to be useful, not useful, and missing from the project. Feel free to report issues with suggestions, constructive criticism, and anything else that should be considered. Pull requests are (very) welcome, but please consider the goals of the project when adding to it. Fork away!
